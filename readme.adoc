# So you've got to install OCP? - 

For exmaple, you're deploying IBM Cloud Pak or for another piece of software and you can't use a managed version such as ROSA, ARO or RHOIC.  

# 1. **Are you an edge case?** The most important thing you need to establish when considering an OCP installation.  

If you are an edge case and you don't know this failure is almost certain.  

What you need to know about making the OCP installers successful in edge case circumstances?

This section of this guide talks about the basic things you need to answer to make the installer work and provides the context as to why before you embark on an install.  Are you an edge case?  There are certain build time selections, that if selected can't easily be walked back, and if you do fall into these edge cases then there is a high liklihood of failure and / or significant rework if incorrect selections are made.  Careful selection based on your requirements is neccessary.

## First - a cautionary note about the safe padded room that is the IPI installer, the Cluster Management website, and the Assisted Installer

Openshift provides a number of installation mechanisms to make the cycle of an installation of OCP easy, namely the IPI installation and the cluser management website.  These provide an easy mechanism to install OCP as long as you have fulfilled the appropriate pre-reqs.  

### But

The ease of the install using the cluster management website, the IPI installer and the assisted installer belies complexity that becomes apparent when you step outside of a standard internet connected installation on VMware, Nutanix, AWS, Azure, or RHV installation supported by these methods.

### And

Day 1 and 2 operations of OCP are very different to day zero installation of OCP - repeat ofter me

Day 1 and 2 operations of OCP are very different to day zero installation of OCP... 

Day 1 and 2 operations of OCP are very different to day zero installation of OCP... 

Day 1 and 2 operations of OCP are very different to day zero installation of OCP - repeat it one last time for good measure...

what do I. mean by Day 0 installation of OCP? - **I mean the things required to make the basic installation of OCP work.**


## Soft am I an edge case? - THE QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO ASK.

1. Is my installation on VMware, Nutanix, AWS, Azure, or RHV?
   - if no then you are an edge case and pre-requisite requirements need to be designed in order to install any OCP and the UPI bare metal installer must be used.
   - if yes, then do I have resource creation rights on my VMware, Nutanix, AWS, Azure, or RHV?
   - if no then then you are an edge case and pre-requisite requirements need to be designed in order to install any OCP using IPI.
2. Will my installation allow all nodes to access to internet and this won't be change (ie, this is not an airgapped OCP installation)
   - if no thenthen you are an edge caseand need to follow the disconnected installation instructions to create an airgapped installation of OCP
   
## What's important in this context of installation in an internet connected install using the UPI bare metal / universal installer?

- CIDR block(s)
- Load Balancers
- DNS Server
- Time Server (NTP)
- DHCP / Static IPs
- NFSv4 mount
- PXE (optional) or other way to boot an image
- TFPT (optional or other way to obatin an image

## What's important in this context of installation in a disconnected mode using the UPI bare metal / universal installer?

- CIDR block(s)
- Load Balancers
- DNS Server
- Time Server (NTP)
- DHCP / Static IPs
- NFSv4 mount
- PXE (optional) or other way to boot an image
- TFPT (optional or other way to obatin an image
