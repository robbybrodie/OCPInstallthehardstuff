# So you've got to install OCP?

Maybe for an IBM Cloud Pak? or for another piece of software? 
and you can't use a managed version such as ROSA, ARO or RHOIC.  

This guide talks about the basic things you need to answer and provides the context as to why before you embark on an install.

Why this guide? there are certain build time selections, that if selected can't easily be walked back.  Careful selection based on your requirements is neccessarily

## First - a cautionary note about the safe padded room that is the IPI installation, the cluster management website, and the assisted installer

Openshift provides a number of installation mechanisms provided to make the cycle of an installation of OCP easy namely the IPI installation and the cluser management website.  These provides an easy mechanism to install OCP as long as you have fulfilled the appropriate pre-reqs.  

### But

The ease of the install using the custer management website, the IPI installer, assisted installer belies complexity that becomes apparent when you step outside of a standard internet connected installation on VMware, Nutanix, AWS, Azure, or RHV installation.

### And

Day 2 operations are very different to day one installation of OCP - repeat ofter me

Day 2 operations are very different to day one installation of OCP... 

Day 2 operations are very different to day one installation of OCP... 

Day 2 operations are very different to day one installation of OCP - repeat it one last time for good measure...

## THE QUESTIONS YOU NEED TO ASK.

1. Is my installation on VMware, Nutanix, AWS, Azure, or RHV?
   - if no then then pre-requisite requirements need to be designed in order to install any OCP and the UPI bare metal installer must be used.
   - if yes, then do I have resource creation rights on my VMware, Nutanix, AWS, Azure, or RHV?
   - if no then pre-requisite requirements need to be designed in order to install any OCP using IPI.
2. Will my installation allow all nodes to access to internet and this won't be change (ie, this is not an airgapped OCP installation)
   - if no then then follow the disconnected installation instructions to create an airgapped install.
   
## What's important in this context of installation in an internet connected install using the UPI bare metal / universal installer?

- CIDR block(s)
- DNS
- Time (NTP) 
- Storage
- DHCP/ Static IPs

## What's important in this context of installation in a disconnected mode using the UPI bare metal / universal installer?

- CIDR block(s)
- Load Balancers
- DNS Server
- Time Server (NTP)
- DHCP / Static IPs
- NFSv4 mount
- PXE (optional) or other way to boot an image
- TFPT (optional or other way to obatin an image
